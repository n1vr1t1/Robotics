# UR5 Simulation Repository

This repository provides **auxiliary resources** to help students and robotics enthusiasts visualize simulations and create new nodes for their projects. It complements the [**pla10/ros2_ur5_interface**](https://hub.docker.com/r/pla10/ros2_ur5_interface) Docker image, which delivers a pre-configured ROS 2 Jazzy environment tailored for the **UR5 manipulator robot**.
This repo is included, at its latest release, in the /home/ubuntu/ros2_ws of the [**pla10/ros2_ur5_interface**](https://hub.docker.com/r/pla10/ros2_ur5_interface) Docker image.

The resources in this repository were developed for the **"Fundamentals of Robotics" course** at the **University of Trento** and aim to streamline project development and learning.

## Features
- **Simulation visualization**: Tools to interact with the UR5 simulation in a graphical environment.
- **Example ROS 2 nodes**: Includes a sample node for trajectory publication to get you started.
- **Launch files**: Ready-to-use launch files for interacting with the simulated or real UR5 robot.
- **Bash scripts**: Simplifies running the UR5 simulation and ROS 2 environments with pre-defined commands.

## Prerequisites
- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
- **Docker Network Setup**: Create a Docker network named `ursim_net` before running the containers:
  ```bash
  docker network create --subnet=192.168.56.0/24 ursim_net
  ```

## Simulation
You can choose between two simulation environments:
- **URSim**: A graphical simulation environment for the UR5 robot that uses a dedicated Docker container. This solution is preferred since it is lightweight and simulates the real connection with the robot. But with this solution you can simulate ONLY the robot, not the environment (no cameras, external sensors, etc).
- **Gazebo**: A more complex simulation environment that uses the ROS 2 Gazebo bridge and is included in the [pla10/ros2_ur5_interface](https://hub.docker.com/r/pla10/ros2_ur5_interface) Docker image.

## How to Use (URSim)
### 1. Start the UR5 Simulator
Run the URSim container using the provided bash script:
```bash
bash scripts/ur5.sh
```
This starts the [pla10/ursim_e-series](https://hub.docker.com/r/pla10/ursim_e-series) Docker container for UR5 simulation. Access the simulator via your browser at [http://localhost:6080](http://localhost:6080).

To prepare the robot to work with ROS2 you need to go to the program tab and add the URCaps > External Control.

---

### 2. Start the ROS 2 Interface
Run the ROS 2 container using the provided bash script:
```bash
bash scripts/ros2.sh
```
This starts the [pla10/ros2_ur5_interface](https://hub.docker.com/r/pla10/ros2_ur5_interface) container. Access the environment via noVNC at [http://localhost:6081](http://localhost:6081).

The user password is "ubuntu".

---

### 3. Run ROS 2 Nodes
- Open a terminal inside the ROS 2 container (accessible via noVNC).
- Navigate to the ROS 2 workspace:
  ```bash
  cd /home/ubuntu/ros2_ws
  ```
- Source the ROS 2 setup:
  ```bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ```
- Launch the control nodes using the provided launch files:
  ```bash
  ros2 launch ros2_ur5_interface interface.launch.py
  ```

## How to Use (Gazebo)
### 1. Start the UR5 Gazebo Simulation
Run the ROS 2 container using the provided bash script:
```bash
bash scripts/ros2.sh
```
This starts the [pla10/ros2_ur5_interface](https://hub.docker.com/r/pla10/ros2_ur5_interface) container. Access the environment via noVNC at [http://localhost:6081](http://localhost:6081).

- Open a terminal inside the ROS 2 container (accessible via noVNC).
- Navigate to the ROS 2 workspace:
  ```bash
  cd /home/ubuntu/ros2_ws
  ```
- Source the ROS 2 setup:
  ```bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ```
- Launch the simulation nodes using the provided launch files:
  ```bash
  ros2 launch ros2_ur5_interface sim.launch.py
  ```

### 2. Run ROS 2 Example Node
Run the trajectory publication node to visualize the UR5 robot moving:
```bash
ros2 run ros2_ur5_interface publish_trajectory_node
```

## Connect to the real UR5 robot
Check the robot's IP address by following these steps:
1. Press the burger menu button on the top right of the robot's teach pendant.
2. Select "Settings".
3. Navigate to "System" > "Network".
4. Check the IP address.

<br><br>
   
Check under the installation tab if in the URCaps > External Control your IP address is the same as the one you are using to connect to the robot.

<br><br>

To connect to the real UR5 robot you need to specify the IP address of the robot when launching the interface.launch.py file. You can do this by adding the following argument to the launch command:
```bash
ros2 launch ros2_ur5_interface interface.launch.py robot_ip:=<robot_ip>
```
